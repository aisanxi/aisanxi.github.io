I'm an observational seismologist at Institute of Geophysics and Geomatics, China University of Geosciences. My primary research interests lie in understanding the dynamics and deformation of the Earth's interior. Especially, I'm trying to understand how the magnificent Tibetan Plateau are formed and how the surficial architecture is linked to the dynamics of the deep interior. To better undertand the Earth, I also have strong interests in topics about seafloor seismology and skills from machine learning. 

Mostly, I dear with the ground vibration excited by earthquakes or seismic ambient noise and map the crust and uppermost mantle structure. Some computation tools for geoscientific research, such as tools for joint inversion of Love and Rayleigh waves for crustal radial anisotropy, joint inversion of Rayleigh wave ellipticity, phase velocity and receiver functions for high-resolution crustal structures and tools for corrections of seismic sensor misorientation and off-great-circle travel effects of telesiesmic Rayleigh wave, are available by reaching me (aisanxi@cug.edu.cn; sanxi.ai@qq.com).
